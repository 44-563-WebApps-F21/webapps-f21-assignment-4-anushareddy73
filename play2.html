        <h3> An Ideal Husband
        </h3>
        <h4>The octagon room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house in Grosvenor Square
        </h4>

    <h5 class="MRS_CHEVELEY"> MRS_CHEVELEY. </h5> 
    <p class="speech">But have we really met before,
Lady Chiltern?  I can’t remember where.  I have been out of England for
so long.</p>

<h5 class="LADY_CHILTERN"> LADY_CHILTERN. </h5>   
<p class="speech">We were at school together, Mrs. Cheveley.</p>

<h5 class="MRS_CHEVELEY"> MRS_CHEVELEY. </h5> 
<p class="stage_direction">[_Superciliously_.] </p>
<p class="speech"> Indeed?  I have forgotten all about my
schooldays.  I have a vague impression that they were detestable.</p>

<h5 class="LADY_CHILTERN"> LADY_CHILTERN. </h5>  
<p class="stage_direction">[_Coldly_.] </p>
<p class="speech"> I am not surprised!</p>

<h5 class="MRS_CHEVELEY"> MRS_CHEVELEY. </h5>  
<p  class="stage_direction">[_In her sweetest manner_.]</p> 
<p class="speech"> Do you know, I am quite
looking forward to meeting your clever husband, Lady Chiltern.  Since he
has been at the Foreign Office, he has been so much talked of in Vienna.
They actually succeed in spelling his name right in the newspapers.  That
in itself is fame, on the continent.</p>
