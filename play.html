    <h5 class="MRS_CHEVELEY"> MRS_CHEVELEY. </h5> 
    <p class="speech">But have we really met before,
Lady Chiltern?  I can’t remember where.  I have been out of England for
so long.</p>

<h5 class="LADY_CHILTERN"> LADY_CHILTERN. </h5>   
<p class="speech">We were at school together, Mrs. Cheveley.</p>

<h5 class="MRS_CHEVELEY"> MRS_CHEVELEY. </h5> 
<p class="stage_direction">[_Superciliously_.] </p>
<p class="speech"> Indeed?  I have forgotten all about my
schooldays.  I have a vague impression that they were detestable.</p>

<h5 class="LADY_CHILTERN"> LADY_CHILTERN. </h5>  
<p class="stage_direction">[_Coldly_.] </p>
<p class="speech"> I am not surprised!</p>

<h5 class="MRS_CHEVELEY"> MRS_CHEVELEY. </h5>  
<p  class="stage_direction">[_In her sweetest manner_.]</p> 
<p class="speech"> Do you know, I am quite
looking forward to meeting your clever husband, Lady Chiltern.  Since he
has been at the Foreign Office, he has been so much talked of in Vienna.
They actually succeed in spelling his name right in the newspapers.  That
in itself is fame, on the continent.</p>

<h5 class="LADY_CHILTERN"> LADY_CHILTERN. </h5>  
<p class="speech">I hardly think there will be much in common between you
and my husband, Mrs. Cheveley!</p>
<p class="stage_direction"> [_Moves away_.]</p>

<h5 class="VICOMTE_DE_NANJAC"> VICOMTE_DE_NANJAC. </h5> 
<p class="speech"> Ah! chère Madame, quelle surprise!  I have not seen
you since Berlin!</p>

<h5 class="MRS_CHEVELEY"> MRS_CHEVELEY. </h5>  
<p class="speech">Not since Berlin, Vicomte.  Five years ago!</p>

<h5 class="VICOMTE_DE_NANJAC"> VICOMTE_DE_NANJAC. </h5>  
<p class="speech">And you are younger and more beautiful than ever.
How do you manage it?</p>

<h5 class="MRS_CHEVELEY"> MRS_CHEVELEY. </h5>  
<p class="speech">By making it a rule only to talk to perfectly charming
people like yourself.</p>

<h5 class="VICOMTE_DE_NANJAC"> VICOMTE_DE_NANJAC. </h5>  
<p class="speech">Ah! you flatter me.  You butter me, as they say here.</p>

<h5 class="MRS_CHEVELEY"> MRS_CHEVELEY. </h5>  
<p class="speech">Do they say that here?  How dreadful of them!</p>

<h5 class="VICOMTE_DE_NANJAC"> VICOMTE_DE_NANJAC. </h5> 
<p class="speech">Yes, they have a wonderful language.  It should be
more widely known.</p>

<p class="stage_direction">[SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _enters_.  _A man of forty_, _but looking somewhat
younger_.  _Clean-shaven_, _with finely-cut features_, _dark-haired and
dark-eyed_.  _A personality of mark_.  _Not popular—few personalities
are_.  _But intensely admired by the few_, _and deeply respected by the
many_.  _The note of his manner is that of perfect distinction_, _with a
slight touch of pride_.  _One feels that he is conscious of the success
he has made in life_.  _A nervous temperament_, _with a tired look_.
_The firmly-chiselled mouth and chin contrast strikingly with the
romantic expression in the deep-set eyes_.  _The variance is suggestive
of an almost complete separation of passion and intellect_, _as though
thought and emotion were each isolated in its own sphere through some
violence of will-power_.  _There is nervousness in the nostrils_, _and in
the pale_, _thin_, _pointed hands_.  _It would be inaccurate to call him
picturesque_.  _Picturesqueness cannot survive the House of Commons_.
_But Vandyck would have liked to have painted his head_.]</p>

<h5 class= "ROBERT_CHILTERN"> ROBERT_CHILTERN. </h5>  
<p class="speech">Good evening, Lady Markby!  I hope you have brought
Sir John with you?</p>

<h5 class="LADY_MARKBY"> LADY_MARKBY. </h5>  
<p class="speech">Oh! I have brought a much more charming person than Sir
John.  Sir John’s temper since he has taken seriously to politics has
become quite unbearable.  Really, now that the House of Commons is trying
to become useful, it does a great deal of harm.</p>

<h5 class="ROBERT_CHILTERN"> ROBERT_CHILTERN. </h5>  
<p class="speech">I hope not, Lady Markby.  At any rate we do our
best to waste the public time, don’t we?  But who is this charming person
you have been kind enough to bring to us?</p>

<h5 class="LADY_MARKBY"> LADY_MARKBY. </h5>  
<p class="speech">Her name is Mrs. Cheveley!  One of the Dorsetshire
Cheveleys, I suppose.  But I really don’t know.  Families are so mixed
nowadays.  Indeed, as a rule, everybody turns out to be somebody else.</p>

<h5 class="ROBERT_CHILTERN"> ROBERT_CHILTERN. </h5>  
<p class="speech">Mrs. Cheveley?  I seem to know the name.</p>

<h5 class="LADY_MARKBY"> LADY_MARKBY. </h5> 
<p class="speech">She has just arrived from Vienna.</p>

<h5 class="ROBERT_CHILTERN"> ROBERT_CHILTERN. </h5>  
<p class="speech">Ah! yes.  I think I know whom you mean.</p>

<h5 class="LADY_MARKBY"> LADY_MARKBY. </h5>  
<p class="speech">Oh! she goes everywhere there, and has such pleasant
scandals about all her friends.  I really must go to Vienna next winter.
I hope there is a good chef at the Embassy.</p>

<h5 class="ROBERT_CHILTERN."> ROBERT_CHILTERN. </h5>  
<p class="speech">If there is not, the Ambassador will certainly have
to be recalled.  Pray point out Mrs. Cheveley to me.  I should like to
see her.</p>

<h5 class="LADY_MARKBY"> LADY_MARKBY. </h5>  
<p class="speech">Let me introduce you.</p> 
<p class="stage_direction">[_To_ MRS. CHEVELEY.]</p>  
<p class="speech">My dear, Sir Robert Chiltern is dying to know you!</p>

<h5 class= "ROBERT_CHILTERN"> ROBERT_CHILTERN. </h5>  
<p class="stage_direction">[_Bowing_.]</p>  
<p class="speech">Every one is dying to know the
brilliant Mrs. Cheveley.  Our attachés at Vienna write to us about
nothing else.</p>

<h5 class="MRS_CHEVELEY"> MRS_CHEVELEY. </h5>  
<p class="speech">Thank you, Sir Robert.  An acquaintance that begins with
a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship.  It starts in the
right manner.  And I find that I know Lady Chiltern already.</p>

<h5 class="ROBERT_CHILTERN"> ROBERT_CHILTERN. </h5>  
<p class="speech">Really?</p>

<h5 class="MRS_CHEVELEY"> MRS_CHEVELEY. </h5>  
<p class="speech">Yes.  She has just reminded me that we were at school
together.  I remember it perfectly now.  She always got the good conduct
prize.  I have a distinct recollection of Lady Chiltern always getting
the good conduct prize</p>

<h5 class="ROBERT_CHILTERN"> ROBERT_CHILTERN. </h5>  
<p class="stage_direction">[_Smiling_.]</p>  
<p class="speech">And what prizes did you get, Mrs.
Cheveley?</p>

<h5 class="MRS_CHEVELEY"> MRS_CHEVELEY. </h5>  
<p class="speech">My prizes came a little later on in life.  I don’t think
any of them were for good conduct.  I forget!</p>
